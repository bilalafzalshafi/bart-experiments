# Quick BART Posterior Estimation Test Results

## Test Design

This test validates that a quick BART run (50 samples, 25 burn-in) provides adequate approximation of the BART posterior for use in semiparametric transformation learning. The test compares quick BART predictions against a gold standard long BART run (1000 samples, 500 burn-in) on synthetic nonlinear data.
